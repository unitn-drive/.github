# UniTN DISI Drive

Italian speaking ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹? Read the [italian version](profile/README.md).

----------

- *What is the Drive?*

The Drive is a collection of notes, handouts, books, and whatnot, maintained by DISI students themselves.

- *How does it work? What tools do I need to take advantage of it?*

The Drive is based on a series of *repositories*, one per course, which are administered through Git and GitHub.

> Are you a novice student and don't know how they work? Here are some tutorials that might help you:

- *How do I ask to join?*

Log on to [https://inviter.rizzi.network/](https://inviter.rizzi.network/), request a token with **YOUR UniTN ACCOUNT** (then to the email **@students.unitn.it**). On the next page, enter the **GitHub nickname** (which does not have to match your university account) and wait for the invitation to arrive.

To summarize:

- Log in to the site linked above,
- Enter your **UniTN account as a student**,
- Enter the OTP code you received on the above email,
- On the new page that opens, enter your **GitHub nickname**,
- Accept the invitation.

The procedure seems convoluted, but it is deliberately so to avoid access to resources by inauthorized people, spambots, and non-University people.

- *How does the organization work?*

A GitHub org is nothing more than a collection of repositories managed by a group of people. Within it, once joined, you will find a repository for each course. We encourage those joining for the first time to read the README you will find inside once you have accepted the invitation.

- *How do I get in touch with the organizers?*

We will give all kinds of communication on this Telegram channel: [@unitnDrive](https://t.me/unitndrive).

- *I don't understand a damn thing, who can I contact?*

Contact [mfranzil](https://github.com/mfranzil) or [Toniolo-Marco](https://github.com/Toniolo-Marco) if you have no idea where to start, if you have encountered problems, or if you want content within the organization to be deleted. Alternatively, you can contact us at `unitn.drive@gmail.com`.
